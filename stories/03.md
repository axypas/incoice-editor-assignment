# US3 — Create a new invoice (minimal form)

## Story
- **As** a user
- **I want** to create a new draft invoice
- **So that** it appears in my list and can later be finalized

## Acceptance Criteria
- Form fields (minimal): customer (id or picker), date, invoice number, line items (product or description, quantity, unit price).
- Totals area shows computed subtotal/total if the API expects client-side calculation; otherwise show what the API returns.
- Submit calls the create endpoint from the OpenAPI client; on success, route back to the list and show the new invoice.
- Validation: required fields; quantity > 0; unit price ≥ 0; show error summary on `422`.

## Edge Cases
- API `422` validation error → highlight fields and show messages.
- Duplicate invoice number (if API enforces uniqueness) → show a distinct error.
- Network failure → show non-blocking error and keep user input intact.

## Test Notes
- RTL: happy path (form → API → list updates); one `422` field error case.
