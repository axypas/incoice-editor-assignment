# US1 — List invoices (table view)

## Story
- **As** a user
- **I want** to see my invoices in a table
- **So that** I can understand status at a glance and take actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Table shows at least: invoice number, customer (name or id), date (ISO or localized), total/amount if present in payload, and finalized (boolean or label).
- Row actions: “Finalize” (if not finalized) and “Delete” (visible; see US4 constraints).
- Loading state (skeleton or spinner), empty state (“No invoices yet”), and error state (retry button).

## Edge Cases
- API returns `200` with `[]` → render empty state.
- Missing optional fields → render “—”.
- Large payload → table scrolls; avoid layout shift during load.

## Test Notes
- RTL: list displays rows after fetch; error path renders banner with retry.
