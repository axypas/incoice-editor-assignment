# US2 — Filter & find invoices (date and invoice number)

## Story
- **As** a user
- **I want** to filter invoices by date from and invoice number search
- **So that** I can quickly find what I need

## Acceptance Criteria
- Two controls above the table: (a) From date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), (b) Invoice number text field.
- On submit, compose the filter query param as a JSON array:

```json
[
  { "field": "date", "operator": "gteq", "value": "<YYYY-MM-DD>" },
  { "field": "invoice_number", "operator": "start_with", "value": "<text>" }
]
```
- Send both filters together when both are present (Company API requirement).
- While filters are active, a “Clear filters” control resets to the unfiltered list.

## Edge Cases
- Invalid date format → show inline validation error; do not hit the API.
- No matches → show filtered empty state (“No results match your filters”).

## Test Notes
- RTL: applying filters results in a new `getInvoices` call with the correct serialized filter param (spy/assert the param); renders fewer or matching rows.

## Principle Notes
- Empathize Relentlessly: inline validation; clear empty-results message; accessible clear-filters control.
- Build Excitement: show compact active-filter summary for confidence.
