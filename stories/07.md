# US7 — “Advanced features & ideas” doc stub (required by brief)

## Story
- **As** a reviewer
- **I want** a short section listing 3–5 useful features with why, prototype, and what is missing
- **So that** I can see your product thinking

## Acceptance Criteria
- Add a `FUTURE_WORK.md` (or README section) describing:
  - Why (user need)
  - Prototype (what you would build)
  - What is missing (API limits or technical constraints)
- Candidate ideas: duplicate invoice, draft autosave, customer/product autocomplete, bulk finalize, PDF or print preview.
