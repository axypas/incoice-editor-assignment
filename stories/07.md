# US6 — Basic accessibility & UX hardening (cross-cutting)

## Story
- **As** a user relying on keyboard or screen reader
- **I want** clear focus order, labels, and confirmations
- **So that** I can complete flows confidently

## Acceptance Criteria
- All buttons have accessible names; confirm dialogs trap focus; `ESC` closes non-destructive dialogs; destructive dialogs need explicit confirmation.
- Loading states expose `aria-busy` or text equivalents.
- Table headers use real `<th>` elements; actionable icons include `aria-label`.

## Edge Cases
- Focus returns to the row or table caption after actions.

## Test Notes
- Playwright (a11y smoke): tab through controls; assert focus behavior around dialogs.

## Principle Notes
- Challenge the Basics: cover core a11y behaviors (focus order, names) without over-engineering.
- Empathize Relentlessly: return focus predictably; meaningful labels for SR users.
- Embrace Speed: keep e2e checks lightweight and deterministic; avoid slow audits.
- Build Excitement: polished interactions that feel reliable and professional.
