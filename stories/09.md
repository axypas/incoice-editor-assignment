# US8 — Future work documentation with industry-standard features

## Story
- **As** a product team
- **I want** a documented roadmap of high-value invoice features
- **So that** we can prioritize based on user needs and technical feasibility

## Acceptance Criteria
Create `FUTURE_WORK.md` with 5-7 features following this structure:
1. **Feature Name**
   - **Why** (specific user pain point)
   - **Prototype** (MVP implementation approach)
   - **What's missing** (technical/API constraints)
   - **User impact** (stress reduced, time saved)

## Required Features to Document

### 1. PDF Generation & Preview
- **Why**: Users need official documents to send to customers
- **Prototype**: Client-side PDF generation with template, preview before download
- **Missing**: PDF template API, legal compliance requirements per country

### 2. Product/Service Catalog
- **Why**: Repeatedly typing same items wastes time and causes inconsistencies
- **Prototype**: Searchable dropdown with recent/favorite items, quick-add new items
- **Missing**: Products API endpoint, catalog management UI

### 3. Recurring/Scheduled Invoices
- **Why**: Monthly/annual subscriptions require manual recreation
- **Prototype**: Template system with scheduling, auto-generate on schedule
- **Missing**: Scheduling service, template storage, notification system

### 4. Payment Tracking & Reminders
- **Why**: Chasing payments is stressful and time-consuming
- **Prototype**: Mark as paid/partial, auto-calculate outstanding, send reminders
- **Missing**: Payment gateway integration, email service, payment status webhook

### 5. Multi-currency Support
- **Why**: International businesses need accurate exchange rates
- **Prototype**: Currency selector per invoice, real-time conversion display
- **Missing**: Exchange rate API, currency configuration, historical rates

### 6. Bulk Operations
- **Why**: End-of-month processing of many invoices is tedious
- **Prototype**: Multi-select with bulk finalize, delete, export, email
- **Missing**: Batch API endpoints, background job processing

### 7. Smart Invoice Numbering
- **Why**: Manual numbering causes duplicates and gaps
- **Prototype**: Auto-increment with patterns (INV-2024-001), per-customer sequences
- **Missing**: Sequence management API, configuration UI

## Documentation Requirements
- Prioritize by user impact (high stress reduction first)
- Include rough effort estimates (S/M/L)
- Note dependencies between features
- Suggest A/B test opportunities

## Principle Notes
- Challenge the Basics: Document but don't build until metrics justify
- Empathize Relentlessly: Each feature addresses specific accountant stress
- Embrace Speed: Define smallest valuable slice for each feature
- Build Excitement: Paint vision of comprehensive invoice platform
