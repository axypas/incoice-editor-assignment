# US5 — Delete an invoice (row action; draft-only if API enforces)

## Story
- **As** a user
- **I want** to delete an invoice
- **So that** I can remove drafts I do not need

## Acceptance Criteria
- “Delete” opens a destructive confirm dialog with focus trapping and keyboard support.
- On confirm: call delete; on success remove the row and announce through a live region.
- If the API only allows deleting draft invoices (common in Pennylane v2), disable or hide delete on finalized rows, or handle `4xx` responses gracefully (Company API expectation).

## Edge Cases
- `404` (already deleted by someone else) → show neutral “Already removed” toast and refresh.
- `403`/`409` (finalized not deletable) → show error toast and keep row.

## Test Notes
- RTL: delete success removes row; `409` path shows error.

## Principle Notes
- Challenge the Basics: destructive action only where allowed; no pseudo-undo unless safely supported.
- Empathize Relentlessly: clear destructive copy; keyboard support; live-region announcement on removal.
- Embrace Speed: optimistic row removal with rollback on failure; treat 404 as neutral.
- Build Excitement: crisp removal feedback without blocking the user.
